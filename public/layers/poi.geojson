The meeting occurred at the site of Council Bluffs. The Oto tribe was part of the Southern Sioux tribes and they resided along the Missouri River. Their livelihood was based mostly on hunting the buffalo but they also farmed. Their huts were oven-shaped, earth-covered houses grouped into towns. Upon meeting them, Lewis remarked \"Those two parts of nations, Ottos and Missouries, now residing together is about 250 men\". However, due to smallpox, this number represented only a fraction of what the population had once been. The disease that had wiped out much of the Native Americans had severely depleted their numbers. The meeting at Council Bluffs involved several chief members of the tribes and the Lewis & Clark Expedition. During the council, the Native Americans were told they were the \"children\" of a new \"great father\" who would provide them with trade and protection in place of their unreliable commerce with the French and the Spanish. It was a speech Lewis would deliver to numerous tribes throughout the journey.", "Synopsis level": "complex synopsis", "Journal Entries": "https:\/\/lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu\/item\/lc.jrn.1804-08-03#lc.jrn.1804-08-03.01", "Secondary Source": null, "geometry": "point", "latitude": 41.523, "longitude": -95.985, "Picture": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -95.985, 41.523 ] } },

They part ways with Sacagawea and Charbonneau.  Clark later regrets not remunerating Sacagawea for her work.\n\nThe expedition returned to Mandan village to find that their 1804 fort had burnt to the ground. The cause remains unknown. While Lewis and Clark had continued their westward journey, the Mandan had been locked in conflict with other local tribes, including the Sioux. The Mandan were glad to see the expedition again, and send them gifts of corn, beans, and squash. Lewis and Clark parted ways with Sacagawea and Charbonneau—fittingly, the site of their first meeting. Clark later regretted not remunerating Sacagawea for her work; without her diplomatic, translation, and navigational skills, the expedition's success would have been jeopardized. That Sacagawea assisted the Corps of Discovery so extensively was a significant accomplishment. At the age of sixteen, she crossed the country with an infant on her back and provided the expedition with crucial support. Her establishment of contacts with indigenous peoples and contributions to the expedition's natural history remain salient aspects of American history.
